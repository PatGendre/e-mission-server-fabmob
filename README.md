This is the README for e-mission-phone FabMob

The description and docs of the "Traceur de Mobilit√©s" project for FabMob are here : https://oultim.frama.site/

The full original README for e-mission-phone is here : https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/blob/master/README.md

See also the e-mission doc repo here : https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docs/

Our modifications from the e-mission-server master branch are twofold :
- configuration
- use of the Shankari/ground_truth_matching branch (for better matching of trips to the public transit)
